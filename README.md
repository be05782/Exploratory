* plot1.R, Plot2.R, Plot3.R and Plot4.R produce graphs as requested [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/exploratory-data-analysis/peer/ylVFo/course-project-1)
* plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png and plot4.png are the PNG files containing the graphs produced by the corresponding plotx.R codes
* readdata.r is also used to avoid to repeat the load and preparation of the data for each plot.

## Data used
